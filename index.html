                <h3> My Tech Story...</h3>
            </p>
            <p> It all started Christmas Morning 1989 me and my little brother would wake up to a life changing gift eventhough we wouldn't know it at the time. Santa Clause had given us Prodigy it was a disk that would allow us to connect to people all over
                the world. At the time I had no clue just what the web would bring and the amount of time I would spend on "bulletin boards". Fastforward a few years to highschool this is when i would first begin learning Html and build my 1st website.
                <p>After returning from a study abroad progam in Italy (art history) I had the urge to start building again, so I decided to signed up for a web design class at the local JC.
                    <p>From there I would build a few more sites for friends and then move into a new job of helping create an online refercen center for a music distrubuter. After that project ended in the early 2000's I would move on to the telecom industry.
